# Module2-Variables-Operators-and-Assignment

When you program, you will often need to store data in order to use it later. Variables often work the way they do in Algebra, but the interpreter will do the math for you! There is a basic html page titled Module2Exercises.html we'll be using today. However, we mostly just want to use the console.

Also, now that we are editing code, it might be a good idea to start testing out some extensions.
VS Code Supports many different extensions that make our lives easier. You are free to test out as many as you please, but 
here are a few that I recommend:
    - Auto Rename Tag
    - Better Comments
    - Live Server
